Dear Huong-san

Inc.'s security audit calls for the shutdown of emergency response “FortiClient” VPNs.

I hear that the reason we started “FortiClient” is because of the disconnection of the RAS environment provided by Inc.

But now RAS is harder to disconnect, says Inc.
Therefore, it is necessary to check the current RAS environment on the CVN side.
I tried RAS connection for a few days from home and never got disconnected.

Therefore, could you check the connection status of the RAS environment at your home.
Especially check the behavior around the RPA.
The deadline is Friday the 18th.

< Test scenario >
(1):  Please use the ID and initial password below
        Please see the attachment for the initial settings.

RAS ID	Initial Passwod	Test User

Reproducibility check with i-station type RAS for CINC from home (icon # 1 -10)
Please connect from the red frame in the figure below.

If disconnection occurs, try (2) below.
*It also has settings to mitigate disconnection.

Please let me know if disconnection does not occur.
The FotiClient is in the direction of stopping.
 

(2): Reproducibility check with i-station type RAS for CINC from home (icon # 11 mitigation has been implemented)
* I put the retry setting when disconnecting on the i-station side.
Make sure it is acceptable as a mitigation measure during replication
Please check if this still causes a disconnect.
